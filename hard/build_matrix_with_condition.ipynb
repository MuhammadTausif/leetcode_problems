    "### 2392. Build a Matrix With Conditions (repeat)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a positive integer k. You are also given:\n",
    "\n",
    "a 2D integer array rowConditions of size n where rowConditions[i] = [abovei, belowi], and\n",
    "\n",
    "a 2D integer array colConditions of size m where colConditions[i] = [lefti, righti].\n",
    "\n",
    "The two arrays contain integers from 1 to k.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have to build a k x k matrix that contains each of the numbers from 1 to k exactly once. The remaining cells should have the value 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "The matrix should also satisfy the following conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "The number abovei should appear in a row that is strictly above the row at which the number belowi appears for all i from 0 to n - 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number lefti should appear in a column that is strictly left of the column at which the number righti appears for all i from 0 to m - 1.\n",
    "Return any matrix that satisfies the conditions. If no answer exists, return an empty matrix.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input: k = 3, rowConditions = [[1,2],[3,2]], colConditions = [[2,1],[3,2]]\n",
    "    Output: [[3,0,0],[0,0,1],[0,2,0]]\n",
    "    Explanation: The diagram above shows a valid example of a matrix that satisfies all the conditions.\n",
    "    The row conditions are the following:\n",
    "    - Number 1 is in row 1, and number 2 is in row 2, so 1 is above 2 in the matrix.\n",
    "    - Number 3 is in row 0, and number 2 is in row 2, so 3 is above 2 in the matrix.\n",
    "    The column conditions are the following:\n",
    "    - Number 2 is in column 1, and number 1 is in column 2, so 2 is left of 1 in the matrix.\n",
    "    - Number 3 is in column 0, and number 2 is in column 1, so 3 is left of 2 in the matrix.\n",
    "    Note that there may be multiple correct answers.\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input: k = 3, rowConditions = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,1],[2,3]], colConditions = [[2,1]]\n",
    "    Output: []\n",
    "    Explanation: From the first two conditions, 3 has to be below 1 but the third conditions needs 3 to be above 1 to be satisfied.\n",
    "    No matrix can satisfy all the conditions, so we return the empty matrix.\n",
